/**
 * We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.
 * 
 * For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign
 * represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left).
 * Each asteroid moves at the same speed.
 * 
 * Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids
 * meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will
 * explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.
